Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner by the owner Danny Ma.

 pizza consumption worldwide reaches an astounding 115 million kilograms daily (So, Wikipedia claims.) As Danny scrolled through his Instagram feed, his attention was captured by a headline proclaiming: "80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!" Danny was instantly captivated by the idea. However, he recognized that pizza alone wouldn't attract the seed funding required to propel his pizza empire to new heights. Therefore, Danny devised a brilliant strategy to combine pizza with the ease of on-demand delivery, giving birth to Pizza Runner.

Danny's initial move was to enlist a team of "runners" responsible for delivering fresh pizzas from Pizza Runner Headquarters, which, for the time being, resided in his own home. Additionally, he maxed out his credit card to engage freelance developers, tasked with creating a mobile app that would facilitate seamless customer order placement.
